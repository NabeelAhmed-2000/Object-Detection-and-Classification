# Object-Detection and Classification
Real-time and Non-real-time Object Detection and Classification

This repository uses a pre-trained deep learning-based object detection and classification model "[MobileNet-SSD v3](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/TensorFlow-Object-Detection-API)" to detect, classify, and label objects belonging to 80 different classes by making use of the [MS COCO](https://cocodataset.org/#home) (Microsoft Common Objects in Context) dataset.

## Technical details
The coding was done fully in python using [Python v3.12.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3127/) in [Jupyter Notebook v7.2.2](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) through [Anaconda Navigator v2.6.4](https://www.anaconda.com/) platform. Labels were constructed and fixed/edited in [labels.txt](/labels.txt) file using [mscoco_label_map.pbtxt](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/45ecd69155b8279d550e1d51f1cc01e5f0eeaebb/research/object_detection/data/mscoco_label_map.pbtxt) as a reference.

## Project Showcase

1. **Non-real-time Object Detection in a sample image**
   - Sample input image

     - To test with your own image, modify the code in 'In [7]' of file [source_code_image.ipynb](/source_code_image.ipynb) as shown below:\
       `img = cv2.imread('original_sample_image.jpg')` to `img = cv2.imread('your_image_name')`
       [Line 88](/source_code_image.ipynb#L88)

   - Sample output image

2. **Non-real-time Object Detection in a sample video**
   - Sample input video
  
     - To test with your own video, modify the code in the very first line of 'In [8]' of file [source_code_video.ipynb](/source_code_video.ipynb) as shown below:\
       `sample_video = "original_sample_video.mp4"` to `sample_video = "your_video_name"`

     <br/>
     <br/>
       
   - Sample output video

     - Due to limited resources of the machine, object detection happens at a slightly lower frame rate of 16 FPS in the output video.
     - The video runs in full-screen by default. Press `f` to toggle between full-screen and windowed modes. Press `q` to stop object detection and close the video.

3. **Real-time Object Detection**

   - For Real-time Object Detection through the webcam or any other imaging device, tap '1' in the user prompt, and enter a resolution to begin the Object               Detection. Enter only the supported standard resolutions to avoid breaking any functionality of the code. If resolution is not known, enter 640x480 as the          resolution as it is OpenCV's default resolution for video capture.  
     
     `cap = cv2.VideoCapture("original_sample_video.mp4")` to `cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)`

     if `cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)` does not work, or if there are multiple cameras, try changing the index `(0)` to 1, 2, etc. based on the camera to be used.
